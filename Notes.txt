To Do:
- Make file reader more general: for reading any CSV file
- Make main() variables read from file, not hardcoded
- Make init simulation in main() a class --> main() only times and runs

***Very Important***
- Robot speed is 0.2 m/s
- By incrementing each step to reach the next node, e.g. += 0.2 until total distance traveled = distance of edge,
    will run into problem of doubles --> 2.9999999999
- Therefore the distance to travel may take extra steps, or over-estimate (this one is o.k. I think)
- Solution: multiply by 10 to deal with integers


===========================================
Notes during Implementation:
- Do I need a current node value for the agent, if I have the destination node?
- Should I maintain all nodes visited by the agent in a list?
- IMPORTANT: How do I manage updating the average idle time at the last time step? I shouldn't update it until that node is declared as being visited.
- Agents do not change trajectory mid-flight. Once they declare a node, they reach that node and do not do any further calculations until they reach it.
    - e.g. If an agent is mid-travel and another hits a node, the mid-travel agent still moves towards the destination
