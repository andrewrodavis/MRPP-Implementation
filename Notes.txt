To Do:
- Make file reader more general: for reading any CSV file
- Make main() variables read from file, not hardcoded
- Make init simulation in main() a class --> main() only times and runs

***Very Important***
- Robot speed is 0.2 m/s
- By incrementing each step to reach the next node, e.g. += 0.2 until total distance traveled = distance of edge,
    will run into problem of doubles --> 2.9999999999
- Therefore the distance to travel may take extra steps, or over-estimate (this one is o.k. I think)
- Solution: multiply by 10 to deal with integers
